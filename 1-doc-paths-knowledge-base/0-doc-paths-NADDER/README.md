# 📦 Project NADDER Template

This repository is a reusable **Obsidian vault structure** based on the NADDER system — designed to support reproducible thinking, writing, and analysis across projects.

## 🌱 Purpose

The goal of this template is to provide a clean, consistent folder system for managing project-related notes, drafts, and reflections, especially for research, technical writing, and collaborative work.

## 🧰 Structure (NADDER)

The vault includes the following folders:

- `01_Notes`: raw notes, excerpts, meeting notes, and AI outputs
- `02_Analyses`: syntheses, thematic connections, conceptual mapping
- `03_Drafts`: working documents, partial outputs, evolving ideas
- `04_Docs`: final or near-final documents, polished outputs
- `05_Engagement`: collaboration records, stakeholder comms, agendas
- `06_Reflections`: personal logs, thought tracking, project insights
