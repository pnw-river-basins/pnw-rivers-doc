# 05_Engagement Overview

In this folder we organize and coordinate efforts to reach out to external parties to obtain feedback on [[04_Docs]]. Part of this efforts include notes about specific people, draft emails, email responses. Additional content from [[01_Notes]], [[02_Analyses]], and [[03_Drafts]] could be compiled and rendered in different formats like word, pdf, or just markdown. Potentially this folder could be structure using the $P^3$ model (People, Products, Platforms)
