## 🧱 Folder Integration Strategy

This vault is designed to be copied into a project’s `knowledge_base/` directory. The `.obsidian/` folder contains personalized configurations and plugin states, excluding ephemeral files like `workspace.json`.

> ✅ You can copy `.obsidian/` from this vault into any new or existing vault to retain your style and layout.

## 🧠 Workflow Notes

- No custom hotkeys or interface layouts are included yet — these evolve organically with active projects.
- Once stable, settings are copied back into this template for reuse.

## 🔄 Updating This Config

When you change plugins, appearance, or layout preferences in an active project, consider updating this file and the `.obsidian/` folder in the `project_NADDER_template` to reflect your latest working style.

> Be intentional — consistency across vaults helps reduce friction and decision fatigue.
